# Solar Energy Analysis and Decision Tool

**I. Overview**
This repository is designed to help users evaluate the feasibility and benefits of installing a solar water heater or solar PV system. It combines theoretical foundations, practical tools, and resources to assist users in making informed decisions regarding solar energy systems.

**II. Project Components**

1. Theoretical Foundation
Comprehensive explanation of solar energy principles and how it can be converted into heat or electricity.
Covers key concepts such as:
Solar radiation fundamentals
Heat transfer mechanisms in solar water heaters
Photovoltaic effect and solar PV performance considerations

2. RETScreen E-Textbook
A detailed guide to using RETScreen, a powerful software for analyzing renewable energy projects.
The textbook walks through:
Setting up RETScreen for solar energy analysis
